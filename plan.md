#### Placeholder Strategy
- Replace `/api/placeholder/...` with `https://via.placeholder.com/`
- Maintain original image dimensions
- Example: 
  - `/api/placeholder/1200/600` → `https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600`
  - `/api/placeholder/112/28` → `https://via.placeholder.com/112x28`

### 3. Footer Standardization
